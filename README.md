## How to Install

Jomato is an unofficial application **not available on the Google Play Store**, which may trigger security warnings during installation. This is expected behavior. The following guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process for installation and initial setup.

### Step 1: Download the APK

- Navigate to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/jatin-dot-py/jomato-mobile/releases)
- Select and download the latest file, such as `Jomato-v1.0.1.apk`

### Step 2: Install the App

Locate the downloaded APK file in your device's file manager or notifications and tap it to begin installation.

You will encounter a **Play Protect warning** indicating that the app is from an unknown developer.

You have two options:

- **Option A:** Select **"Install without scanning"** to proceed directly with installation
- **Option B:** Select **"Scan app"** and after the scan completes, choose **"Install"**

> **Note:** These warnings occur because the app uses a personal key signature and hasn't been reviewed by Google Play. The source code is publicly available in this repository for verification and transparency.

### Step 3: Open the App

Once installation is complete, open Jomato. You'll see the home screen with the **Food Rescue widget** option.
